# Development Workflow

## Available Scripts
- `npm run dev` - Start development server (Vite dev server)

- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint to check code quality

## Development Server
- Default port: 5173 (Vite default)
- Hot Module Replacement (HMR) enabled
- Fast refresh for React components
- Automatic browser refresh on file changes

## Build Process
- Uses Vite for fast builds
- Outputs to `dist/` directory

- Fix all ESLint errors and warnings
- Follow the established code patterns
- Test components in the browser during development

## File Watching
